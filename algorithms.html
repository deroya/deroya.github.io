 <h2> All about algorithms...</h2>
It seems that hardly a day can go by without hearing about algorithms. They are becoming more and more ubiquitous, and one could easily believe they'll soon run every aspect of our lives.
 But what exactly is an algorithm?
 <br><br>
 Simply put, an algorithm is a sequence or set of instructions that a computer needs to solve a problem. We can think of an algorithm as a formula, an instruction manual, or even a recipe,
 deisgned to tell the computer how to preform a specific task. Algorithms are precise, seuqential, and finite- the computer preforms each specific step in sequence to generate the desired outcome.
 <br><br>
 Algorithmic thinking is just that- breaking a problem down into a series of defined steps, each with its own solution, that can be implemented one at a time (<a href="https://learntocodewith.me/posts/algorithmic-thinking/">Learn To Code With
 Me, 2020</a>). While training yourself to think like this can obviously be useful for coding, it's also a useful life skill that emphasizes problem-solving and 
 critical thinking.
 <br><br>
 From search engine results to our Netflix recomendations to social media newsfeeds, algorithms truly dominate our digital world. While they can make life easier, they also
 control much of the information we take in online, sometimes unbeknownst to us. So let's dive in a take a closer look at just how infulential algorithms have become in our daily
 lives...
