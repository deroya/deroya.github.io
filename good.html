 <h2>The Good</h2>
Algorithms have some obvious benefits. By their very nature, they take larger problems and break them down into smaller, solveable steps. Problems that once may have
 seemed insurmountable in the world of computer science can now be divided into smaller portions and solved efficiently with algorithmic thinking.<br><br>
 On the user end, the most obvious benefit is convienience- whenever automation comes into play, the result is time saved for the user. Can you imagine if you opened up
  Netflix and were faced with an empty screen and a search bar? Just thinking of the all the cheesy Christmas movies I'd miss out on is heartbreaking. While it can lead to endless scrolling (more on that later...) I for one
  enjoy the convience of the currated list of recommended shows and movies. Algorithms can also suggest products you may like on shopping websites and, ideally, predict customer
  needs <i>before</i> any frustrating problems arise. Who wouldn't want to be able to get all their Christmas shopping done with just a few clicks?
  The result is a smooth experience that is convinient and enjoyable for the customer, and in turn provides better sales for the store.
 <br><br>
 And what about search engines? Imagine if you typed "chocolate cake recipe" into Google and every webpage ever created that contained those words popped up, in random
 order? Or what if they were even returned chronologically? You'd have to do quite a bit of scrolling through shady Geocities sites from 1997 before you started to turn up
 more modern recipe blogs, and even then you'd have no way of knowing if the recipes were any good. When I search for a recipe, I know the top results will be recent, popular
 pages, usually with a high number of positive reviews. All thanks to the algorithm.

It's not only the retail sector that benefits. Using algorithms, companies can break down large, complex sets of data to be analyzed efficiently. Applications for loans or even
 jobs can be reviewed by algorithms and effeiciently sorted based on empirical data before a human ever sees them. Not only can this save enourmous amounts of time 
 (and therefore money) for a corporation or a bank, but candidates can find out almost instantly if their application is successful.
 <br><br>In theory, well-written algorithms can even remove
 human bias from these decision making processes- Uber famously uses an algorithm to match riders and drivers that does not take gender into consideration. Though a gendered
 pay gap does exist for more complex reasons (such as surge pricing in unsafe areas where women are less likely to accept fares) 
 (<a href= "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/07/09/a-study-of-uber-drivers-found-that-workplace-flexibility-may-not-close-the-gender-pay-gap/">Moore, 2018</a>),
 the algorithm has made progress toward narrowing it by removing selector biases from the equation.</p>

 <h2>The Bad & The Ugly</h2>
 Of course, with all the advantages of algorithms come the downsides. Social media sites such as YouTube and Instagram use algorithms to keep you scrolling as long as possible-
 they're addictive by deisgn. I personally don't think social media is all bad or vapid; I love being able to see what my friends are up to on Instagram, and I enjoy honing
 my amatuer photography skills and posting memories of beautiful places I've been. I've also wasted <i>way</i> too much time scrolling through my recommended feed or reels looking
 at...random junk. And sure, I can have the app notify me when I've spent a certain amount of time  on it... and then  I can just as easily close the warning and 
 keep scrolling. If you're at all inclined toward procrastination, the algorithm can be your worst enemy. As a thirty-something adult whose brain was pretty much fully formed
 before social media really took over, it's just a time-waster for me. But I can't imagine being a teenager today, using an app designed to keep me scrolling for hours, looking
 at unrealistically beautiful people and places, encouraging me to buy things... 
 <br><br>
 Another major problem is bias. In theory, algorithms can and should eliminate discrimination- a machine can't be racist or sexist, it can only evaluate based on data. However,
 algorithms are built by humans, and we're just as capable as bias as we've ever been. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/01/21/137783/algorithms-criminal-justice-ai/">
 Karen Hao's 2019 article</a> outlines how criminal risk assesment algorithms- designed to save time and allocate resources appropriately- unfairly target low-income and 
 minority individuals. The algorithms are based on historical data- which may itself be biased- and use correlation to determine a defendant's likelihood of reoffending. If law enforcement in the area has historically targeted low-income individuals, the
 algorithm will use that <i>correlation</i> to give a low-income defendant a high recidivism score. This score can effect where someone serves their sentence, their access to
  rehabilitation services, and even the length of a sentence. All based on historically biased data and on correlation, not causation.

 This leads to the larger, far-reaching problem with algorithms. We're slowly letting them run our lives, and most people are unaware of how they work, and just how powerful
 they are. Does the average person know if prison sentences in their area are based on an algorithm? If so, do they realize why that could produce biased results? I deleted
 my Facebook app months ago (A+ decision, highly recommend), but some of my older family members use it religiously. Do they realize what they see isn't random, but curated
 by an algorithm that has been historically unsuccessful at detecting fake news (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-click-gap-news-feed-changes/">Dreyfuss & Lapowsky, 2019)</a>?
 Algorithms generally aren't transparent, and most of us do not posess the digital literacy skills needed to make sense of and evaluate them. And even if we did- then what?
 Algorithms rely on data. If I decide I don't want to sacrifice my personal data to feed the algorithms of the world, do I delete all my social media? Do I cancel all streaming services and go back to
 paying $100+ every month for cable? I make a concious effort not to use Amazon, but is it realistic for me to give up all online shopping in the midst of a global pandemic? I'm honestly uncomfortable with the
 influence algorithms exert on our daily lives and the amount of personal data they collect, but I've become resigned to it and tell myself it's just a numbers game. There are
 billions of people using the internet, interacting with algorithms, and having their data collected. I'm one number in a sea of many, and though I don't agree with my data being
 collected on principle, the odds that anything nefarious or unfortunate will happen to me because of it are low. Not a great philosophy, but one we have to reckon with if we
 want to participate with the world around us in the internet age.
