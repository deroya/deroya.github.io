  <h2>The world of wet food...</h2>
<p class="two">The crisp sound of a can being opened is recognized by cats the world over, and more than one cool kitten has lost her composure over it 
  (don't lie, we've all been there!). But did you know not all wet foods are created equal? Some are better than others, and you are your own best advocate in convincing 
  your human to buy quality wet food!
  <br>
  A few years back, I was eating the cheapest grocery store brand available (we won't name names, but you know <i>the one</i>). I was sluggish and coughing up hairballs with
  <i>embarassing</i> frequency. The vet has me on a powdered probiotic that was unpleasant to the taste and showed minimal results. It wasn't until one fateful trip to the 
  emergency vet (<i>never</i> be afraid to get a second opinion!) that everything changed. That kind doctor recommended Fancy Feast, and after two years of zero digestive issues,
  I'm here to recommend it to you!</p>
