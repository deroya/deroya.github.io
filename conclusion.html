 <h2>Conclusion</h2>
So, are algorithms good or bad? In my opinion they're both and, perhaps more importantly, it doesn't matter anymore. Algorithms are here to stay and artificial inteligence is the future.
 The focus now should be on how to ensure they're being used ethically.
 <br><br>
 The European Union's <i>Right to Explanation</i> legislation is a start (<a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/impact-stories/a-right-to-explanation" target="_blank">The Alan Turing Institute, 2020</a>).
 While I do believe more legislation is needed in the realm of machine learning, I also think personal education is just as imporant. First of all, voters can't push for such laws
 if they have no understanding of how algorithms work or are effecting their lives. And I also believe everyone has a right to understand how their personal data is being used,
 and what kind of footprint we leave any time we use the internet. An informed citizenry is key to regluating the use of algorithms- if we understand what they do and decide what
 boundaries we're willing to accept, we can understand and make noise when we think AI has gone too far. Simply shrugging our shoulders and saying, "I don't care how it works
 as long as Amazon keeps recommending me cool gadgets," is a disservice to ourselves and our fellow netizens.
 <br><br>
 We've looked at Netflix and Instagram, Google and Uber, and examined just a few simple ways algorithms affect our day to day lives. But in the interest of going out with a bang,
 I've saved the best for last. In 2019, a group of "artists, musicians, and programmers" (<a href="https://youtu.be/4MKAf6YX_7M target="_blank">Sweaty Machines, 2019, para. 2</a>) used data from
  previous Eurovision Song Competition entries to create a musical materpiece, written and composed entirely by AI. One YouTube commenter points out, <i>"Based on the lyrics, I'm worried Artificial Intelligence is depressed."</i>
  Another boldly claims, <i>"It's a song about periods."</i> Some may claim it's the height of human achievement in the realm of machine learning, but I'll leave that up to you:
