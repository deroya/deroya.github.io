 <h2>The Good</h2>
Algorithms have some obvious benefits. By their very nature, they take larger problems and break them down into smaller, solveable steps. Problems that once may have
 seemed insurrmountable in the world of computer science can now be divided into smaller portions and solved efficiently.<br><br>
 On the user end, the most obvious benefit is convienience- whenever automation comes into play, the result is time saved for the user. Can you imagine if you opened up
  Netflix and were faced with an empty screen and a search bar? I know I probably wouldn't last long. While it can lead to endless scrolling (more on that later...) I for one
  enjoy the convience of the currated list of recommnded shows and movies. Algorithms can also suggest products you may like on shopping websites and, ideally, predict customer
  needs <i>before</i> any frustrating problems arise. Who wouldn't want to be able to get all their Christmas shopping done with just a few clicks?
  The result is a smooth experience that is convinient and enjoyable for the customer, and in turn provides better sales for the store.
 <br><br>
 There's also the human element- or, more specifically, the lack of it. In theory, algorithms should remove instrinsic human biases from certain decisions. 
  If you're applying for a mortgage or a job, a properly-written algorithm won't filter based on race or other discriminatory factors; a good algorithm <i>can't</i> be biased,
  it can only assess everyone based on the same empirical criteria. As DataEthics points out, by collecting more data through algorithms, banks can actually recude their risks
  and provide <i>more</i> loans.
 <br><br>
 Algorithmic thinking is just that- breaking a problem down into a series of defined steps, each with it's own sultion, thaty can be implemented one at a time (Learn To Code With
 Me, 2020). While training yourself to think like this can obviously be useful for coding, it's also a useful like skill that emphasizes problem-solving and 
 critical thinking.
 <br><br>
 From search engine results to our Netflix recomendations to social media newsfeeds, algorithms truly dominate our digital world. While they can make life easier, they also
 control much of the information we take in online, sometimes unbeknownst to us. So let's dive in a take a closer look at just how infulential algorithms have become in our daily
 lives.
