<p class="two">Ladies, it's time to get honest and talk about an embarassing problem we've all experienced- mats. They're uncomfortable. They're unsightly. And they're all
too common, especially as the seasons change and out new coats come in. If your human is as hopeless as mine, you've been subject to everything from scissors to olive oil
