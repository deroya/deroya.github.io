 Ladies, it's time to get honest and talk about an embarassing problem we've all experienced- mats. They're uncomfortable. They're unsightly. And they're all
too common, especially as the seasons change and out new coats come in. If your human is as hopeless as mine, you've been subject to everything from scissors to olive oil
to shaving (the ultimate indignity, no offence to our hairless sisters). We all feel our best when our coats are silky and smooth, and mats can take a big toll on even the
proudest cat's confidence.
<br>
<br>
Friends, I've got two words for you: <i>dematting. tool.</i> I know they look sharp and scary, but they're deceptively foolproof- even the most incompetent of humans can now
remove your mats with a gentle hand! Check out this video of the top 5 tools of 2019 for some inspo:</p>

 <p class="two">Confession time: not only does a good dematting tool cut through those pesky clumps of fur as if they were butter, but it actually feels <i>good</i>. I was always staunchly
 anti-brushing, and now find myself looking forward to it! Though I still recommend some wiggling and even a bit of scratching when the brush comes out, just to keep your
 human in their place (but <i>that's</i> a whole other post...).
 <br>
 <br>
As far as I'm concerned, a dematting tool is the must-have accessory this season. Have your human pick one up and you'll be <i>feline</i> your best all winter long!
